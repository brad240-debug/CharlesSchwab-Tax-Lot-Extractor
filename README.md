## Data Structure

The extension organizes extracted tax lot data hierarchically:

```javascript
{
  "holdingsAccount_[ID]": [
    {
      "[SYMBOL]": [
        {
          "open_date": "MM/DD/YYYY",
          "quantity": 100,
          "price": 150.00,
          "cost_per_share": 150.00,
          "market_value": 15000.00,
          "cost_basis": 15000.00,
          "gain_or_loss": 500.00,
          "gain_or_loss_percentage": 3.33,
          "holding_period": "Long"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Development

### Building for Distribution

```bash
npm run build              # Create dist/ folder and .zip file for Chrome Web Store
```

This creates:

- `dist/` folder with all extension files ready for development
- `schwab-tax-lot-extractor-v{version}.zip` ready for Chrome Web Store upload

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch         # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage      # Run tests with coverage report
```

### Test Coverage

The project maintains 80%+ test coverage across all modules:

- ✅ 52 passing tests
- ✅ Utils, Extractor, Storage, and Exporter modules fully tested
- ✅ TDD approach followed throughout development

### Architecture

The extension uses a message-passing architecture:

1. **Popup** → **Background** → **Content Script** for commands
2. **Content Script** → **Background** → **Popup** for status updates
3. **Chrome Storage API** for data persistence and state management

### Key Components

- **Extraction Engine**: Processes Schwab's DOM structure to extract lot details
- **State Management**: Tracks progress and handles interruption/resume
- **Export System**: Converts data to JSON/CSV with proper formatting
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic with exponential backoff for reliability

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome version 88+ (Manifest V3 support)
- Works with Schwab's React-based web application
- Handles dynamic page updates and loading states

## Security

- No external network requests
- All data processed locally in the browser
- Sensitive data cleared from memory after export
- Content Security Policy compliant

## Performance

- Processes each position within 5 seconds
- Handles portfolios with 100+ positions
- Memory usage under 50MB
- Supports concurrent tab usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No buttons found"**: Ensure you're on the correct Schwab positions page
2. **Extraction fails**: Check that you're logged into Schwab and can see your positions
3. **Modal doesn't open**: Some positions may not have lot details available

### Error Recovery

The extension includes automatic retry logic and can resume from where it left off if interrupted.

## Development Notes

This extension was built using:

- **Pure JavaScript** (no TypeScript or frameworks)
- **TDD methodology** (tests written before implementation)
- **Vanilla DOM APIs** for maximum compatibility
- **Chrome Extension Manifest V3**

Based on the proven logic from the original bookmarklet script that has been manually tested and validated.
